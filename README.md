# qb-phone
This is a version of qbus v3 phone that I continued to mess around with over the years after the initial qbus v3 leak, adding more apps and small usability tweaks like home screen scrolling and hiding app icons based on held items, like a vpn. I'm now tired of sitting on this, and hopefully it will benefit some people looking for app ideas or whatever.


### Special Note
This script is not plug-and-play and is probably horribly exploitable, in it's current form. I use mongodb and have left those queries in place, as I cba to put in any effort to make this work with whatever frameworks or versions are out there. It is up to YOU to make this code work in your server. I will not be providing support for this. Best of luck.
